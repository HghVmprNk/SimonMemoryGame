# SimonMemoryGame

Hello, so this is my attempt to do a Simon Memory game. 

Essentially, the square light up and create a sequence where you have to memorize and then press the squares following the same sequence. The moment you complete the sequence, a new sequence will commence. It is increasing the level. For level 2 it is the same structure i just added more squares.
